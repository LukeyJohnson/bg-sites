### Combine compliance and quality assurance
Empower workforces with micro-learning videos and critical instruction to help prevent on-and-offsite safety incidents and improve quality outcomes.

### Modernise workplace training
Reinvent how you deliver training by capturing key messages in short micro-learning videos and hosting them on the DS Site platform for on-demand access.

The DS Site user interface makes it easy to distribute visual content directly to workers, guaranteeing consistent practices and helping them to complete tasks or projects on time and within budget.

## DS Site’s Digital Passport

**Manages compliance and training information**

Imagine how much time and money both you and your workers could save if licenses, tickets, and other compliance information were readily available, and reminders for their currency maintained automatically?

The DS Site mobile app provides a free digital passport that collects, stores, and manages commonly accessed compliance information in a worker profile. That information can be used to auto-fill forms, inductions, and training records without unnecessary double handling from site-to-site and job-to-job.

* **Store Information:** Refresh knowledge anywhere, anytime (on and offline).
* **Stay Current:** Instantly receive all updates and notifications to minimise the impact of training and inductions changing one day to the next.
* **Free Access:** A free app for users ensures you don’t miss out on critical visual and digital content, whether you are a full-time employee or sub-contractor.
